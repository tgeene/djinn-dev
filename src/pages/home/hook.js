      <p>The purpose of this site is to not only showcase the work and experience of Trevor Geene, but also to serve as a way to contact me for recieving development services. While this site currently is lacking in work to show off my skills; it is my goal for 2021 to build useful tools and fun experients on this site that even people who do not seem work from me will hopefully enjoy.</p>
